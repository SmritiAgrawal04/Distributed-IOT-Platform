Make A Difference (MAD) is an Indian Non-Profit Organisation, which believes that everybody should have a reasonable quality of life. MAD mobilises young leaders towards ensuring equitable outcomes for children in need of care and protection at shelter homes. 

I volunteered for around 2 years in MAD and served the children in various rules:

Academic Support Volunteer (ASV)- Under this role I tried to enable better academic outcomes by curating an unforgettable classroom experience for children.

Wingman- Enable shelter-leaving youth gear up for and thrive in the real world. Help them develop foundational skills like functional numeracy, literacy, self-confidence and exposure!

Shelter Support Fellow (SSF)- As a SSF, my major role was to operate as a bridge between Shelter Authorities and MAD organisation to ensure the comfort of our children to its best. The fundamental role was to manage city level tasks of MAD like- conduct interviews and recruit more volunteers who could serve our children, raise funds for ensuring  financial security and sustainability for the future of children, encourage and keep the volunteers motivated through presentations enlightenment or any fun activities etc. I acquired leadership, negotiation, teamwork, resource handling and fundraising skills, developed self-confidence.

Dream Camp Lead- Dream Camps are outbound experiential camps that help children dream about their future goals and understand what it takes to achieve those dreams. This understanding is facilitated through personal discovery, exploring new talents by challenging themselves and taking responsibility of their actions for the duration of the camp. Organizing a Dream Camp incurs management and great cost in terms of travel, accomodation, food, session material and other logistics for its 3-4 day operations, all of which was lead by me for Bhopal, M.P.
